I could set both width and height here, or I can choose only the width and the browser will maintain the aspect ratio.  An even better choice is to resize it in an image editor so the file is smaller.  Notice already the file size differences in the img folder.-->

		<p>I even like to make a menu each week.  It helps us to eat healthier and feel more prepared.  It also helps to make a shopping list and get the proper fresh produce when we'll use it.  Notice in the sample menu in Figure 1 that we like to eat a variety of foods each week.</p>
