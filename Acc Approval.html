			<h2>Acc Approval</h2><br> <br>
			
			<p>The goal of the Architectural Control Committee is to preserve the property values of all homeowners in Prairie Fields, and to
					ensure compliance with applicable covenants when a homeowner makes changes to their property. The Covenants for each
					phase of Prairie Fields specify that certain changes to your property require the approval of the Architectural Control
					Committee. This committee of residents within Prairie Fields will review proposed plans and grant approval to proceed. For
					now, this includes items like an addition to your home, building a deck, fence, or shed, or other substantial work which might
					affect your neighbors.</p> <br> <br>

					<p>Homeowners are required to submit plans for fences, decks, sheds or other outbuildings, additions, and other
							structures which require architectural approval to the architectural control committee. You may wish to
							review your Covenants for your particular home, before contacting the ACC.</p> <br> <br>
							<p>Please supply the following information to the ACC by email
									<b id=email> ACC@prairiefieldshoa.com:</b></p> <br> <br> <br>
					<P>Your name and house address: </P> <br> <br>
							<p>• Your email address </p> <br> <br>
							<p>• A description of the work that you plan to do </p> <br> <br>
