             <p><font size="5">There is big difference in Us and India living arrangements for students.  In India there is no such thing has campus living they just have hostel means dorm. United states have so many apartments on campus and out of campus. Even it’s not like regular apartments, they have swimming pool, garden with BBQ, tennis court, squash, squash, and sauna so on. You feel like you are living in a resort. India doesn’t have any kind of thing they just have rooms and bathroom with everybody uses it. In United states they have very well safety because students must use their key card. Living in apartments is much better because you can stay awake as awake as you want. Boys and Girls live on same building even they live as a roommate. In India boys leave on different building and girls live on other. 
				There is difference in US and India classes. First thing, in India college class room are similar as other rooms. For example, students don’t change class room for different classes instructor come to class room where the students are. In United States in college everyone changes the room for example, the students are moving to other class after they are done with there old class and also teacher do the same thing.  Second thing class hour, in India has fixed schedule classes for example in India Monday to Friday class from 8 to 4 and also have lunch break in 1 hours than it starts back to classes. In united states classes hours are different for example, the difference classes if you take 4 classes for math, computer, English so they are only on Monday and Wednesday only 2 classes and then go home, Tuesday and Thursday are only have 2 classes. And they have 2 hours’ brake and then do homework.
				Third thing, is the financial aid, India doesn’t have anything like FAFSA but they just have scholarship for smart students. In United States not only they have financial aid but also all other kind of scholarships. Financial aid (FAFSA) is not only for smart students, but it’s for people who cannot afford their education. For financial you should have certain score around 2.0 and above bellow 2.0 there is no financial aid. I am happy that United States have financial aid because education is getting expensive and expensive.
